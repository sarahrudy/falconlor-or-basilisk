# Turing Sorting Hat

Turing Sorting Hat is an interactive web application geared towards incoming Turing students trying to decide between the frontend or backend program. The user will be directed to a page with 15-25 questions that are designed to help students contemplate their decision towards one or the other. Both programs involve complex logic, problem solving, quick learning, and the ability to overcome obstacles quickly --  hopefully this application will help students confirm the program they are already leaning towards based on what they already know about themselves and software development.

### Learning Goals

This project was the most fun to create to date. We have been working with React for the last 5 weeks and this project allowed us to come up with our own idea, find an API that fit our idea, and create an app that is unique and different. Implementing hooks into the project wasn't a requirement but it was a fun challenge. 

### Contributor

+ [Sarah Rudy](https://github.com/sarahrudy)

### Technologies Used
+ React
+ React Router
+ React Hooks
+ Cypress (testing framework)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

### Instructions for Running and Viewing 

1. Clone this repo to your local computer  
`git clone git@github.com:sarahrudy/turing-sorting-hat.git`
2. Install NPM packages  
`npm install`
3. Run the app from your terminal  
`npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser  

### Future Additions 

+ User will be able to answer more than 15 questions
+ User will be able to navigate to an information page that lists the tech stacks for each program and more information about what each program focuses on 
+ Results page will be customized for the percentage of BE or FE answers the user selected (e.g. if a user selects 60% FE and 40% BE answers, they might see something like "You seem to have an eye for design so you might enjoy the frontend curriculum a little more, but the backend program would also be a good fit for you." 
+ User will be able to see which questions they got correct and which questions they got wrong
